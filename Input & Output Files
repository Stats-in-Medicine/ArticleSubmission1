INPUT FILES
FleishmanRead1.txt has the single value of the number of "cases" (experimental combinations) to be evaluated
FleishmanRead2 has all other input variables.  As an example:
#samples    CentralTendency    Reps    SampleSize    Skew      ExcessKurtosis    Var1    Var2    Mean1    Mean2    Distrib    DistParam 

    1            3            1000        30            0            0             2        2        0        0        1        1

where:
# of Samples = 1 for a 2-Sample study; 0 for a 1-Sample study

Measure of Central Tendency = 3 for median

Distrib = 0 for generating "artificial distributions with the Skew & Kurtosis given; = 1 for LogNormal; = 2 for Exponential
DistParam = Shape Parameter for the LogNormal; Rate Parameter for the Exponential

These input files should be located in:  "C:/Users/{Name of User}/Documents/FleishmanRead1.txt" and 
"C:/Users/{Name of User]/Documents/FleishmanRead2.txt" respectively.
Note:  R expects the forward facing slant "/" rather than the backward facing slant "\" used in Windows.

OUTPUT FILES
The False Alarm Rate ("FAR") of all 6  nonparametric bootstrap programs (Number of Samples (2) x Measure of Centraol Tendency (3)
= 6) will be found at:  C:/Users/{Name of User]/Documents/FAR.txt".

The t-Test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests are always performed and the results will be found at:
C:/Users/{Name of User}/Documents/FAR.t.txt and
C:/Users/{Name of User}/Documents/FAR.wilcox.txt respectively
